Initially, my reaction was "well yeah, it's harder to check for NA then it is to check for a specific value, that's the way it is with floating point arithmetic ..."

It's true and I'll come back to it, but it is less true than the tools we have let you believe. I'll come back to that, but first let's digress. 
Things we call `numeric` in R are `double` precision floating point numbers. They occupy 64 bits (8 bytes) in memory which are arranged
according to the [IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format: binary64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
standard. <span class="note">There are actually several standards as it is usually the case with standards, but `binary64` is the one that seems to have been
almost universally adopted, so I just won't care about the other ones for the sake of simplificity of this post and I guess the sake of the complexity of this sentence that feels like it is never ending ... </span>

[What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) will 
give you more information, but I will illustrate `binary64` with one my weekend package project `seven31`. 
<span class="note">The name of the package is a tribute to the famous [R FAQ 7.31](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f) that is also coevered
by this [question on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9508518/why-are-these-numbers-not-equal) that also has
several links </span>

`seven31` has the functions `reveal` to show the bits of a `double` and the `compare` function to highlight bitwise 
differences between two numbers. `reveal` shows the 3 parts of the 64 bits. <span class="note">and it looks better
when you use it on rstudio or any other environment that supports ansi escape strings, for some 
reason the escape strings are killed here. I'm not sure yet what is responsible for that, and I'll 
be looking into alibis from rmarkdown, knitr, blogdown and rstudio ... some other time. </span>

```{r}
seven31::reveal( 1.0 )
```

### sign and exponent

The first bit is the *sign* bit. 0 means positive, 1 means negative. 

The 11 following bits encode the *exponent* by removing 1023 to the base 2 representation: 

```{r}
strtoi("01111111111", base = 2 )
strtoi("01111111111", base = 2 ) - 1023
```

which is the number that is presented in the `()`. 1023 seems arbitrary, but not so much. There are 2^11 (=2048) different 
possible exponent, but two of them have special meaning.

- `00000000000` is reserved to represent positive and negative zeros. <span class="note">Yes there are two zeroes</span>

```{r}
seven31::reveal( 0, -0)
```

- `11111111111` is reserved for infinity, not a number and in particular for the case of R, missing values, but not so fast, we'll peel off that 
layer of digression later. 

```{r}
seven31::reveal( NaN, Inf, -Inf, NA )
```

Removing these two special cases gives us 2046 possibilities, and it is no coincidence that this is twice `1023`. 

### Fraction

The last 52 bits, plus an additional implicit bit always set to 1, encode the *fraction*, i.e. the linear combination of powers of 2. 
The fraction is read from left to right. The power associated with the implicit bit (again this is always 1) is the *exponent* 
<span class="note">The thing we've seen before that is encoded with the 11 previous bits</span> and the power decreases as we go to the right. 

Let's take the example of 2.75, which we can decompose as `2^{1} + O*2^{0} + 2^{-1} + 2^{-2}`. 

```{r}
seven31::reveal(2.75)
```

- The sign bit is 0, so we have a positive number
- The exponent `10000000000` encodes the value `1` 
- The fraction starts with `011` and then is followed by all `0` to the end. We have to prefix this with the implicit bit to get `1011`. 

```{r}
c(1,0,1,1) * 2 ^ c(1,0,-1,-2)

sum( c(1,0,1,1) * 2 ^ c(1,0,-1,-2) )
```

### The implicit bit and the zeros

The implicit bit has many advantages: 
 - it doubles the number of values that can be associated with an exponent
 - it gives us a unique way to represent each of the representable numbers, using the normalised version, i.e. where the fraction always starts
   with a bit set to `1`. 

However, this means that 0 cannot be represented exactly. This is unacceptable as `0` is one of the most [important numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0), hence the special case when the exponent is `00000000000`. 

### NaN

Similarly, the exponent `11111111111` is reserved for things that cannot be approximated to powers of two, because conceptually 
they are not numbers. Theoretically this gives us `2^52` (i.e. 4.5 quadrillion) possibilities. In practice only a few are used. 

Positive and negative infinity uses the all 0 fraction: 

```{r}
seven31::reveal( Inf, -Inf )
```

Fraction starting by `1` and followed by only `0` is the traditional math *not a number*  that can be used for things like square root of 
negative numbers (let's not talk about complex) or infinbity minus infinity, ... 


```{r}
seven31::reveal( sqrt(-1), Inf-Inf )
```


### NA

R uses the NaN space to encode missing values, which are conceptually not the same as other NaN, because rather than 
saying that the number cannot be represented, it means that there is a number potentially representable, but we don't know 
its value. 

`NA` is encoded by using the bit pattern of 1954<span class="note">this looks too much like a 20th century year to be a coincidence
and in fact <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/C-interface.html">this is year Ross Ihaka was born</a></span> in the lower bits. 

```{r}
seven31::reveal( NA )
strtoi( "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000011110100010", base = 2 )
```
