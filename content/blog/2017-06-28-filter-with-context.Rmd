The new [programming tools](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) that 
arrived with the `0.7` series of [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) are pretty cool. Good bye old clunky
functions suffixed by the underscore and their weird use of `lazyeval::interp`  ... 

The `tidyeval` framework give us a way to make new verbs with `dplyr`-like syntax. It takes 
some getting used to, and might not be the easiest thing to teach, although compared to the old 
approach it makes a lot more sense. In the [webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/whats-new-in-dplyr-0-7-0/)
Hadley said that he does not yet really know how to teach tidyeval. I don't pretend I have it covered, but here's an example
of using tidy eval to filter with context. 

The idea is to add context to `filter`, similar to the `-A` and `-B` options for the unix `grep`, in other 
words we want the lines that match the `filter` condition (as usual), a given number of lines before and 
a given number of lines after. 

To make things simple for now, let's first consider a single `filter` condition, so we want a function with this
interface: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
context_filter <- function( data, expr, before = 0L, after = 0L){
  ...
}
context_filter( mtcars, cyl == 4 )
```

What the tidy eval framework give us is the ability to pass `cyl == 4` by expression so that 
we can inline it into some other expression. The game is to get the indices that match the condition, expand those
to add `before` and `after` indices, and then use these in a `slice` call. 

First we need a tool to do the expanding. Nothing fancy here, just plain old regular `rep` and `seq` stuff. 
For each element in `idx` we add the context, and then we just make sure the indices appear only once 
and are restricted to the extent of the rows 

```{r}
context <- function(idx, n, before = 0L, after = 0L){
  span <- seq( -before, after )
  res <- unique( rep( idx, each = length(span) ) + span )
  res[ res >= 1L & res <= n]
}
context( c(4, 8), 10, before= 1, after = 1)
context( c(4, 5), 10, before= 1, after = 1)
context( c(1, 10), 10, before= 1, after = 1)
```

Now we just need to feed that `context` function with indices:

```{r}
context_filter <- function( data, expr, before = 0, after = 0){
  expr <- enquo(expr)
  slice( data, context(which(!!expr), n(), before, after) ) 
}
```

The tidyeval magic is to: 

  - first capture the expression with `enquo` 
  - then inline it into another expression with the unqoting operator `!!`

So that we can let R do the copy and paste for us: 

```{r}
context_filter( mtcars, cyl == 4, before = 1, after = 1)
```

Now we can genealise this to multiple `filter` conditions with `quos` and `!!!`. 
Each of the `filter` condition gives us a logical vector and we want to `&` them all. That's a job for `Reduce` :

```{r}
Reduce( "&", list( c(T,T,F), c(T,F,F), c(T,T,T) )  )
```

Now we can capture all the conditions given in the `...` by expression and 
splice them into a list via the `!!!` operator: 

```{r}
context_filter <- function( data, ..., before = 0, after = 0){
  dots <- quos(...)
  slice( data, context(which( Reduce("&", list(!!!dots) )  ), n(), before, after) ) 
}
context_filter( mtcars, cyl == 4, disp > 100, before = 1)
context_filter( starwars, skin_color == "gold", eye_color == "yellow", before = 1, after = 1)
```
