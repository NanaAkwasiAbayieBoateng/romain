I was in Milano with the [team](www.thinkr.fr) yesterday,
for my second time as a speaker at the [MilanoR meetup](http://www.milanor.net/blog/). 
I gave a talk about R and C++, where we are, and where I'd like to go next.

For the occasion, I was wearing my `%>%` t-shirt and my dearstalker Sherlock Holmes hat.
