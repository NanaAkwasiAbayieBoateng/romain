<p>The <a href="http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/base/html/warning.html">suppressWarnings</a> function allows to call a function and suppress whatever warning it might generate. This uses the <a href="http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/base/html/conditions.html">calling handler and restart mechanism</a> of R to invoke the special "muffleWarning" restart when a warning is detected by the handler.</p>

<p>The downside is that it removes <span style="font-weight:bold">all</span> warnings, and this might not be what you want. Consider that simple function that gives two warnings: </p>

<pre>
f  f(5)
[1] 8
Warning messages:
1: In f(5) : bla bla
2: In f(5) : yada yada
&gt; suppressWarnings( f(5) )
[1] 8
</pre>

<p>What if I wanted to remove "bla bla" warnings and not "yada yada" warnings, because I know that "bla bla" warnings are expected and are more disturbing that useful. Currently, <code>suppressWarnings</code>
does not offer that possibility, but you can make you own calling handler that handles warnings the way you want: </p>

<pre>
&gt; h  withCallingHandlers( f(5), warning = h )
[1] 8
Warning message:
In f(5) : yada yada
</pre>
</div>
