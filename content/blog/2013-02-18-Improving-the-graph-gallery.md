<p>I'm trying to make improvements to the <a href="http://gallery.r-enthusiasts.com">R Graph Gallery</a>, I'm looking for suggestions from users of the website.</p>

<p>I've started a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/questions/425893104160507/">question</a> on the website's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/R-Graph-Gallery/169231589826661">facebook page</a>. Please take a few seconds to vote to existing improvements possibilities and perhaps offer some of your own ideas. </p>
