Because of imminent birth of my 2nd daughter, I did not get to go to [useR](https://www.user2017.brussels), so I've been 
feeling a mix of frustration, impatience and fomo. I was really pleased to find out that for the second year, part of the 
conference would be streamed live and most of it will be available later. 

{{< tweet 881924861454688256  >}}

I combined watching the live stream and constantly update the column with the `#useR2017` filter on 
my tweetbot, until this started to be overwhelming enough for me to come up with a way 
to visualise the tweet storm from a few angles. This was a good opportunity
to learn the [`rtweet`](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet) package to grab the tweets, and 
[`shinydashboard`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard) for the visualisation. 

A few hours and a few tweets later, we released this as the 
pet project [`tweetstorm`](https://github.com/ThinkRstat/tweetstorm), a shiny dashboard to glimpse activity on 
twitter, to answer some questions: 

- How many tweets from how manuy twitter users
- Related hashtags
- Which tweets were the most fav'ed or retweeted
- Who tweeted the most, was quoted or replied to the most
- ...

Some of use use emojis in our tweets, and I've learned from [Sean Kross](https://github.com/seankross)
how to extract them from the tweet, borrowing a regex from his article: 
[Which Emojis Does Lucy Use in Commit Messages?](http://seankross.com/2017/05/30/Which-Emojis-Does-Lucy-Use-in-Commit-Messages.html)

{{< tweet 883104282924470273 >}}


There are now two emojis things in the app, the first one to appear packs emojis together based on how many times they have
been used, through the [`tweetstorm::extract_emojis`](https://github.com/ThinkRstat/tweetstorm/blob/master/R/tweetstorm.R#L63) function.  

```r
#' Extract emojis
#'
#' @param text text with emojis
#'
#' @return a tibble with the columns `Emoji` and `n`
#' 
#' @references 
#' Inspired from [](http://seankross.com/2017/05/30/Which-Emojis-Does-Lucy-Use-in-Commit-Messages.html)
#' 
#' @export
#' @importFrom stringr str_extract_all str_split
#' @importFrom tibble as_tibble
#' @importFrom magrittr %>% set_names
extract_emojis <- function(text){
  str_extract_all(text, emoji_regex ) %>% 
    flatten_chr() %>% 
    str_split("") %>% 
    flatten_chr() %>% 
    not_equal("-") %>% 
    table() %>% 
    sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    set_names( c("Emoji", "n") )
}
```

There's still some work to deal with [skin tone modifiers](https://github.com/ThinkRstat/tweetstorm/issues/6), 
but it's great to see that the most popular emojis spread love and package use.

The other more emoji related display on the app groups them by users, so that we can verify 
that [Lucy](http://www.lucymcgowan.com) also makes extensive use of emojis on twitter. That's the job 
of the `tweetstorm::extract_emojis_users` function: 

```r
#' Extract information about users that use emojis
#' 
#' @param tweets tweets data set
#' @export
extract_emojis_users <- function(tweets){
  
  data <- tweets %>% 
    select( user_id, text ) %>% 
    mutate( 
      emojis = str_extract_all(text, emoji_regex ) %>% map( not_equal, "-" )
    ) %>% 
    filter( map_int(emojis, length) > 0 ) %>% 
    group_by( user_id ) %>% 
    summarise( 
      emojis = map(emojis, ~ flatten_chr(str_split(., "") ) ) %>% flatten_chr() %>% table() %>% list()
    ) %>% 
    mutate( 
      total = map_int(emojis, sum), 
      distinct = map_int(emojis, length), 
      emojis = map_chr( emojis, ~ paste( names(.)[ order(., decreasing = TRUE)], collapse = "") )
    ) %>% 
    arrange( desc(total) )

  left_join( data, lookup_users(data$user_id), by = "user_id" ) %>% 
    mutate( img = sprintf('<img src="%s" />', profile_image_url ) ) %>% 
    select( img, name, total, distinct, emojis )
  
}
```

I am first there, but that's not fair because at some point while developping the app
I tweeted the list of all the emojis then used so far.

But apart from that, there's no doubt that Lucy uses lots of emojis:

Here's an example: 

{{<tweet 883301098127228928 >}}

The app is live [here](https://thinkr.shinyapps.io/tweetstorm/), it may still change
and/or move to a new url at some point. 

Right now it always uses the data I have extracted between these two instants before it's too late.

```
> tweetstorm::useR2017 %>% pull(created_at) %>% range
[1] "2017-06-29 10:07:14 UTC" "2017-07-11 09:55:06 UTC"
```

I'll keep updating the dataset for some time as there are likely to have new tweets, e.g.
when we go through the slides or videos, ...
