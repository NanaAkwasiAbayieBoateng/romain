<p>We released <a href="/blog/2010/05/17/Rcpp-0.8.0">Rcpp 0.8.0</a> almost a month ago. It finalized our efforts in designing a better, faster and more natural API than any version of Rcpp ever before. The journey from <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2009/12/19/">Rcpp 0.7.0</a> to <a href="/blog/2010/05/17/Rcpp-0.8.0">Rcpp 0.8.0</a> has mainly been a coding and testing effort for designing the API. </p>

<h3>And now for something completely different</h3>

<p>We have now started (with release 0.8.1 of Rcpp) a new development cycle towards the 0.9.0 version with two major goals in mind</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to improve documentation. To that end Rcpp 0.8.1 includes 4 new vignettes. more on that later. </li>
<li>We want to cross the boundaries between R and C++. Rcpp 0.8.1 introduces <strong>Rcpp modules</strong>. Modules allows the programmer to expose C++ classes and functions at the R level, with great ease. </li>
</ul>
<h3>new vignettes</h3>

<p><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf">Rcpp-FAQ</a> :<em>Frequently Asked Questions about Rcpp</em> collects some of the frequently asked questions from the <a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rcpp-devel">mailing list</a> and from private exchanges with many people. </p>

<p><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-extending.pdf">Rcpp-extending</a>:  <em>Extending Rcpp</em> shows how to extend Rcpp converters Rcpp::wrap and Rcpp::as to user defined types (C++ classes defined in someone else's package and third party types (C++ classes defined in some third party library used by a package. The document is based on our experience developping the <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a> package</p>

<p><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-package.pdf">Rcpp-package</a> : <em>Writing a package that uses Rcpp</em> highlights the steps involved in making a package that uses Rcpp. The document is based on the Rcpp.package.skeleton function</p>

<p>finally, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-modules.pdf">Rcpp-modules</a> : <em>Exposing C++ functions and classes with Rcpp modules</em> documents the current feature set of Rcpp modules</p>

<h3>Rcpp modules</h3>

<p>Rcpp modules are inspired from the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/python/doc/index.html">Boost.Python</a> C++ library. Rcpp modules let you expose C++ classes and functions to the R level with minimal involvment from the programmer</p>

<p>The feature is best described by an example (more examples on the vignette). Say we want to expose this simple class: </p>

<p>This would typically involve <a href="/blog/2010/01/08/External-pointers-with-Rcpp">external pointers</a>. With Rcpp modules, we can simply declare <strong>what</strong> we want to expose about this class, and Rcpp takes care of the <strong>how</strong> to expose it: </p>

<p>The R side consists of grabbing a reference to the module, and just use the World class</p>

<p>The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-modules.pdf">Rcpp-modules</a> vignette gives more details about modules, including how to use them in packages</p>
