<p>Searching help pages of contributed packages just got easier with the release of the new <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sos/index.html">sos</a> package. This is a replacement for and substantial enhancement of the existing "RSiteSearch" package.  To learn more about it, try vignette("sos")</p>

<p>We hope you find this as useful as we have.</p>
