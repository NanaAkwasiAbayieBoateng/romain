```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

I've been somewhat obsessing about emojis lately, it all started when I wanted to
check which emojis were used [on twitter](http://romain.rbind.io/blog/2017/07/11/emojis-at-user2017/)
during useR this year.

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 883199852347367424 >}}")`

But this post is not really about emojis, because my [emojitsu](https://github.com/ThinkRstat/emojitsu)
package is not ready yet, but here's a preview anyway.

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 892375718247706626 >}}")`
