<div class="post-content">
<p>On this <a href="/index.php?post/2009/04/18/Colorful-terminal%3A-the-R-package-%22xterm256%22">post</a>, I presented the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xterm256/index.html">xterm256</a> package for R, allowing to have text in background and foreground color in the R console</p>

<p>The drawback of relying on xterm escape sequences is that the package needs to be used within a terminal that supports this escape sequence protocol (basically some linux consoles)</p>

<p>Here, I am proposing a patch to the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xterm256/index.html">biocep workbench</a> that emulates support for these colors directly in the biocep R console, see the screenshot below: </p>

<p>Combined with the syntax highlighter I am working on, this allows syntax highlighting of R code (pretty close to the way R sees the code) directly in the code and is in my view both visually pleasing and very useful</p>

<p>The functionality requires minor modifications of the source code of biocep that I have written and I can send a patch to interested users, but I unfortunately cannot commit the modifications to the biocep project because it is read-only at the moment</p>
