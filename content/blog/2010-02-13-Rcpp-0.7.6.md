<p><a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> 0.7.6 was released yesterday. This is mostly a maintenance update since the version 0.7.5 had some very minor issues on windows, but we still managed however to include some new things as well. </p>

<p>Vectors can now use name based indexing. This is typically useful for things like data frame, which really are named lists. Here is an example from our unit tests where we grab a column from a data frame and then compute the sum of its values: </p>

<p>The classes <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/html/classRcpp_1_1CharacterVector.html">CharacterVector</a>, 
GenericVector(aka List) and 
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/html/classRcpp_1_1ExpressionVector.html">ExpressionVector</a> now have iterators. Below is another example from our unit tests, where we use iterators to implement a C++ version of lapply using the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/transform/">std::transform</a> algorithm from the STL.</p>

<p>Generic vectors (lists) gain some methods that make them look more like <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/">std::vector</a> from the STL : push_back, push_front, insert and erase. Examples of using these methods are available in our unit tests: </p>
