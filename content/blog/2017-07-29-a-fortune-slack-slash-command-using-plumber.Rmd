Most of our internal communication at [ThinkR](http://www.thinkr.fr) goes through Slack, and I'm also 
popping up to other slack teams (e.g. the very active [ropensci](https://ropensci.org) team) from time to time. 

The [slackr](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/slackr) package is great to send stuff (text, plots, ...) to slack from R, 
but let's do the opposite, i.e. query R from slack with a [slash command](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/slash-commands). 

This is my excuse to learn about [plumber](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber) and finally haver something to say when 
people ask me about the `plumber` hex sticker on my laptop. `plumber` is a neat R package that allows you to simply 
create web apis that are mapped to R functions. 

<div style="clear:both" />

Here is the canonical example: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# plumber.R

#* @get /mean
normalMean <- function(samples=10){
  data <- rnorm(samples)
  mean(data)
}

#* @post /sum
addTwo <- function(a, b){
  as.numeric(a) + as.numeric(b)
}
```

We can turn the `plumber.R` file into a web server with the api endpoints `/mean` and `/sum` with the `plumb` function. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(plumber)
r <- plumb("plumber.R")  # Where 'plumber.R' is the location of the file shown above
r$run(port=8000)
```

The [documentation](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/hosting.html) covers several hosting options for a plumber 
server, but for the purpose of this post, I'll just host it on my local host and follow the 
lead from [this article](http://www.girliemac.com/blog/2016/10/24/slack-command-bot-nodejs/) and 
use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to tunnel the command in. I've installed `ngrok` on my mac with homebrew and run it 
directly on a terminal

```
$ brew cask install ngrok
$ ngrok http 3000
```

This gives you a temporary url that tunnels requests to the `3000` port on your machine:

Next we need to create a custom integration at [http://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands](http://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands)

The important part is the `URL` field that is filled with the url we just got from `ngrok`. Once this is done, we have a slash 
command called `/fortune` that uses a panda emoji because why not and send commands to our plumber server via `ngrok`. 

The last thing we need is to make the api with `plumber`. The api is fairly simple and just 
retrieves a fortune from the `fortunes` package, but we sort of need to go around the flexible
interface of `fortunes::fortune`

```{r}
#* @get /
#* @serializer unboxedJSON
fortune <- function( text = NULL){
  if( !is.null(text) ){
    as_num <- suppressWarnings( as.numeric(text) )
    if( !is.na(as_num) ) text <- as_num
  } 
  list( 
    response_type = "in_channel",
    text = paste( capture.output( fortunes::fortune(which=text) ), collapse = "\n")  
  )
}
```

So that we can support a variety of use cases

 - get a random fortune
 - get a fortune by id
 - search fortune by author or content
