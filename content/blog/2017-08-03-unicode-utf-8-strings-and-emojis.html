<p>I’ve been somewhat obsessing about emojis lately, it all started when I wanted to check which emojis were used <a href="http://romain.rbind.io/blog/2017/07/11/emojis-at-user2017/">on twitter</a> during useR this year.</p>

<p>But this post is not really about emojis, because my <a href="https://github.com/ThinkRstat/emojitsu">emojitsu</a> package is not ready yet, but here’s a preview anyway.</p>
