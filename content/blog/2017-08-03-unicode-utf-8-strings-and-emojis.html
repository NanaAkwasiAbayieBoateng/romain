<p>I‚Äôve been somewhat obsessing about emojis lately, it all started when I wanted to check which emojis were used <a href="http://romain.rbind.io/blog/2017/07/11/emojis-at-user2017/">on twitter</a> during useR this year.</p>
{{< tweet 883199852347367424 >}}
<p>But this post is not really about emojis, because my <a href="https://github.com/ThinkRstat/emojitsu">emojitsu</a> package is not ready yet, but here‚Äôs a preview anyway.</p>

<p>So I‚Äôll blog specifically about emojis later, but this has led me to digress down the üêá hole, because emojis are made of unicode runes typically encoded into utf-8 strings. Most of the concepts in that last sentence were quite mysterious to me not so long ago, and I believe we should collectively know more about unicode and utf-8. I learned some of the basics from the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/strings">Strings, bytes, runes and characters in Go</a> post in the go blog, and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>.</p>
<p>Typically when I want to understand something, I make an R package, I guess I really want to understand this, as I am making not 1, not 2 but 3 packages (if I count <code>emojitsu</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uni</code> : contains a tibble of unicode runes</li>
<li><code>utf8splain</code> : to get to the 0 and 1 of utf-8 string encoding</li>
<li><code>emojitsu</code> : grammar of emoji, or at least programmatic manipulation of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The world has changed now, and strings can no longer be considered as mere sequences of single characters (bytes). The <code>uni::code</code> tibble contains the 82719 unicode runes (aka code points). btw, the generation of the <code>uni::code</code> tibble contains some interesting tidyverse gymnatics, perhaps I‚Äôll write another post about that, but let‚Äôs not digress more yet.</p>
