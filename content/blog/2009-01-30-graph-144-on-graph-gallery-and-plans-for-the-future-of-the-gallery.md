I has been a while since I last uploaded a graph in there, mainly because the process of adding a new graph is taking some time and is not that much automated. Many people have sent me suggestion graphics and eventually I will add them ... I promise.

I have the intention of reworking the website so that it will be easier to maintain and other people can get involved, for that I will start by clean the php code behind it and release it into r-forge. For example, I'd like the process of adding a graph to be a bit more community driven instead of just being me selection graph that look good. watch this <a href="http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques">space</a>.</div>
