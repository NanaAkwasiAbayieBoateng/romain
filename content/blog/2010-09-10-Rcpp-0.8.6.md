<p>Dirk released <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> 0.8.6 to CRAN</p>

<p>Most of the development of this release was trigerred by a <a href="http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rcpp-devel/2010-August/000940.html">question</a> on <a href="http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rcpp-devel">the Rcpp-devel</a> mailing list. After Richard's question, we added d-p-q-r functions for most of the distributions available in R.</p>

<p>The file <a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/Rcpp/inst/unitTests/runit.stats.R?view=markup&amp;root=rcpp">runit.stats.R</a> contains several examples of using them. </p>

<p>We have also started developing Rcpp 0.8.7, which will depend on the next version of R (R 2.12.0) since it will use some of the features it will introduce. More on this later...</p>

<p>Dirk also <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2010/09/10/#rcpp_0.8.6">blogged</a> about the release, including the relevant NEWS extract. </p>
