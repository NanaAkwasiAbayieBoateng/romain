						<p>The <code>highlight</code> package has been missing from CRAN for quite some time</p>
<p>Now it is back, with fewer dependencies. It used to depend on <code>Rcpp</code> and <code>parser</code>, but since the code logic from <code>parser</code> has been brought to R, <code>highlight</code> now directly uses <code>getParseData</code>. </p>
