<p>This is a short code snippet that is motivated by this <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Andrews-plot-td25330696.html">thread</a> on r-help yesterday. The gallery contains a search engine textbox (top-right) that can be used to search for content in the website using either its internal crude search engine or perform a google search restricted to the gallery. </p>

<p>Here we write a small R function that can be used to take advantage of the search engine, from R</p>

<pre>
rgg.search </pre>
