<div class="post-content">
<p>Following <a href="/index.php?post/2011/10/08/R-Graph-Gallery-widget-in-R-Bloggers">last post</a> about partnership with <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R Bloggers</a>, <a href="http://www.r-statistics.com/">Tal</a> and I have added a small widget to the gallery main page to present links to recent posts on R Bloggers</p>

<a href="/public/graphgallery/rbloggers-widget.png"><img src="/public/graphgallery/rbloggers-widget_m.jpg" alt="rbloggers-widget.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" title="rbloggers-widget.png, oct. 2011"></a>

<p>It uses the wordpress api to grab information about the rss feed generated by R Bloggers and displays links one at a time using the same <a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/">jquery</a> magic as we've used in the widget that was integrated in R Bloggers a few days ago</p>
