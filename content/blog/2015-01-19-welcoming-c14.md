Since last CRAN release of [Rcpp11](https://github.com/Rcpp11/Rcpp11),
I've started to work on the next iteration of R/C++ support
 with [Rcpp14](https://github.com/Rcpp11/Rcpp14) by propagating changes to
 both implementations, e.g. the <code>Strict</code> class that I mentionned in this
 [post](/blog/2015/01/16/stricter-arguments-in-rcpp11).

But now, I'm starting to make unique changes to <code>Rcpp14</code> for things
that require <code>C++14</code>, which is the whole point.
These should have no effect for typical uses, but will definitely make the code base more manageable.

One such feature is the <code>auto</code> deduction of function return
types in <code>C++14</code>. <code>C++11</code> does not have that feature
so we ended up manually declaring the return type in many places.
Here is for example how <code>ifelse</code> is implemented in <code>Rcpp11</code>: </p>

```
template <typename Cond, typename Expr1, typename Expr2>  
inline auto ifelse( const Cond& cond, const Expr1& expr1, const Expr2& expr2 ) ->  
    decltype(mapply( sugar::ifelse_op(), cond, expr1, expr2))
{
    return mapply( sugar::ifelse_op(), cond, expr1, expr2) ;
}
```

The return type is easier to declare using the `auto ... -> decltype(...)`
construct already, but `auto` return type deduction in C++14
goes further and lets us implement `ifelse` like this:

```
template <typename Cond, typename Expr1, typename Expr2>  
inline auto ifelse( const Cond& cond, const Expr1& expr1, const Expr2& expr2 ) {  
    return mapply( sugar::ifelse_op(), cond, expr1, expr2) ;
}
```

This is minor, and again with no consequence to the end user, but things
like this will make <code>Rcpp14</code> even nicer to develop than <code>Rcpp11</code>.
