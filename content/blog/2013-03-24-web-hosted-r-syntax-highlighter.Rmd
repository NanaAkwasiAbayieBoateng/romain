*update* the feature described here is no longer available. 

[highlight](http://highlight.r-enthusiasts.com/) uses simple
jquery command to syntax highlight R code contained in any regular <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element.

For example, this chunk of code, from the 
[datasets::cars](http://help.r-enthusiasts.com/library/datasets/html/cars.html)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
require(stats)
require(graphics)
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)", las = 1)
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, f = 2/3, iter = 3), col = "red")
title(main = "cars data")
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)", las = 1, log = "xy")
title(main = "cars data (logarithmic scales)")
```

More details is given at [highlights page](http://highlight.r-enthusiasts.com/)
on how to use it on your own page.
