<div class="post-content">
<p>I've started the process of moving the content of this <a href="http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/">page</a> to the <a href="http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=guis:guis">R wiki</a>. The motivation is that the content will become dynamic and updated much more often, people can add their own project, we can have use cases of each gui, tutorials, feature comparison, ...</p>

<p>When we are ready, we will add an entry for the <a href="http://tr.im/rw0p">jedit plugin</a></p>
