<div class="post-content">
<p>I've pushed a new version of the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parser/index.html">parser</a> package to CRAN. </p>

<p>This is the first release that depends on <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a>, which allowed me to reduce the code size and increase its maintainability. </p>

<p>This also features a faster version of <a href="http://search.r-project.org/library/parser/html/nlines.html">nlines</a>, a function that retrieves the number of lines of a text file. </p>
