<p>A good 2 days after 0.7.6 was released, here comes <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> 0.7.7. The reason for this release is that a subtle bug installed itself and we did not catch it in time</p>

<p>The new version also includes two new class templates : unary_call and binary_call that help integration of calls (e.g. Rcpp::Language objects) with STL algorithms. For example here is how we might use
unary_call</p>

<p>This emulates the code</p>

<pre>
&gt; lapply( 1:10, function(n) seq(from=n, to = 0 ) )
</pre>

<p>As usual, more examples in the unit tests</p>
