<div class="post-content">
<p>Here comes yet another sequel of the code optimization problem from the <a href="http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=tips:programming:code_optim2">R wiki</a>, still using <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a>, but with a different strategy this time</p>

<p>Essentially, my <a href="http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2011/11/10/Code-optimization%2C-an-Rcpp-solution">previous version (15)</a> was using stringstream although we don't really need its functionality and it was slowing us down</p>

<p>Also, the characters "i" and "." are always on the same position so we can assign them once and for all</p>

<p>So without further ado, here is attempt 17:</p>

<p>With quite a speedup from attempt 15:</p>

<pre>
                test replications elapsed relative
2 generateIndex17(n)           20   9.363 1.000000
1 generateIndex15(n)           20  17.795 1.900566
</pre>
