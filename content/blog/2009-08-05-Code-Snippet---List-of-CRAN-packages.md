<div class="post-content">
<p>This is a really simple code snippet that shows how to get the list of CRAN packages and their titles from the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html">html page</a> html page (toulouse mirror in this example).</p>

<p>Note that R has the <a href="http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/utils/html/update.packages.html">available.packages</a> function, but it does not give the titles of the packages</p>
