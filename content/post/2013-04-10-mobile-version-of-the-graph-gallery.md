						<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516100159/http://gallery.r-enthusiasts.com/">R Graph Gallery</a> has been a popular website for many years now. The number of graphics keeps growing as people send me their code. </p>
<p>When browsing the website with a mobile device the experience was frustrating, as too much information is presented. So I made some adjustments and now it becomes worth browsing the website with a mobile device. </p>
