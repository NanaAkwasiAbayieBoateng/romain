<p><a href="http://blog.r-enthusiasts.com/2014/07/22/rcpp11-3-1-1-on-cran/"><del>While we wait for CRAN to process the release of Rcpp11 3.1.1</del></a>, here are some news about the Rcpp11 t-shirt. </p>

<p>With more than 40 attendees, the <code>Rcpp11</code> tutorial was a success. I managed to distribute almost all t-shirts I printed for the occasions. I only have a few S sized men t-shirts left, but all women/S and men/M have found an owner. </p>

<p>During the conference, I tried to take some pictures of people taking a stand and wearing the t-shirt ... or just wearing the t-shirt. </p>

<p>I even found a ninja wearing the t-shirt as far as in LAX airport. I admire <a href="@xieyihui">@xieyihui</a> for wearing it where it is not likely to mean anything at all to anyone, although the picture only really shows the "keep calm" part ...</p>

<p>Those are the pictures I have, out of the 40+ t-shirts that were distributed, so I'm suspecting some sort of underground market for these. </p>

<p>Then, the t-shirt was lucky enough to visit around. </p>

<h1 id="lateadditions">Late additions</h1>

<p>Eventhough I did not have time to go to Hollywood boulevard or the Studios to get some celebrities wearing the shirt, the shirt still found a way to reach to the staRs. </p>

<p>Here it is posing with <a href="https://twitter.com/hspter">@hspter</a>'s  Kima. </p>
