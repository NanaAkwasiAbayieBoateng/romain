						<p>Rcpp 0.10.3 is on CRAN.</p>
<p>Here is the part of the NEWS file related to this release</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Changes in R code</h4>
<ul>
<li>
        Prevent build failures on Windowsn when Rcpp is installed in a library path with spaces (transform paths in the same manner that R does before passing them to the build system).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Changes in Rcpp attributes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rcpp modules can now be used with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516103856/http://help.r-enthusiasts.com/library/Rcpp/html/sourceCpp.html">sourceCpp</a>
        </li>
<li>Standalone roxygen chunks (e.g. to document a class) are now transposed into <code>RcppExports.R</code>
        </li>
<li>Added <code>Rcpp::plugins</code> attribute for binding directly to inline plugins. Plugins can be registered using the new<br><code>registerPlugin</code> function.
        </li>
<li>Added built-in <code>cpp11</code> plugin for specifying the use of C++11 in a translation unit
        </li>
<li>Merge existing values of build related environment variables for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516103856/http://help.r-enthusiasts.com/library/Rcpp/html/sourceCpp.html">sourceCpp</a>
        </li>
<li>Add global package include file to <code>RcppExports.cpp</code> if it exists</li>
<li>Stop with an error if the file name passed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130516103856/http://help.r-enthusiasts.com/library/Rcpp/html/sourceCpp.html">sourceCpp</a> has spaces in it</li>
<li>Return invisibly from <code>void</code> functions</li>
<li>Ensure that line comments invalidate block comments when<br>
        parsing for attributes</li>
<li>Eliminated spurious empty hello world function definition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Changes in Rcpp API</h4>
<ul>
<li>The very central use of R API <code>R_PreserveObject</code> and <code>R_ReleaseObject</code> has been replaced by a new system based on the functions <code>Rcpp_PreserveObject</code>, <code>Rcpp_ReleaseObject</code> and <code>Rcpp_ReplaceObject</code> which shows better performance and is implemented using a generic vector treated as a stack instead of a pairlist in the R implementation. However, as this preserve / release code is still a little rough at the edges, a new #define is used (in config.h) to disable it for now.
      </li>
<li>Platform-dependent code in <code>Timer.cpp</code> now recognises a few more BSD variants thanks to contributed <code>defined()</code> test suggestions</li>
<li>Support for wide character strings has been added throughout the  API. In particular <code>String</code>,  <code>CharacterVector</code>, <code>wrap</code> and <code>as</code> are aware of wide character strings
      </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
